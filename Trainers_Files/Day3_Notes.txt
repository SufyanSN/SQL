Views : Are virtual tables where only the view definitions are stored as a part of the schema. They do not carry any data. Hence there is no need for space

-All theoritically updatable views are not proactically updatabale.
-We can perform DML operation on views with single base table, provided the column/s not included in the view can take either null/defaults

Purpose of Views : Enhancing query operations with no need to write the queries agaian and again
For Security Purpose

Similarities between isnull() and coalesce()
1. Both are used to evaluate expressions/columns/variables for null and provide
  a default value as a replacement
2. both return null if all value/s are null
    (for coalesce to return null, we may have to pass a datatype without value
       else it throws error)
3. Both can work with all datatypes

Differences 
1. Coalesce is ANSI compatible and can be used in other SQL Platforms, where as
  isnull() cannot
2. isnull() can take only 2 inputs as against coalesce that can take many inputs

Relational Algebra: Set Operators

union/union all : 
Intersect
Except

Combining one or more queries to produce a final resultset
The resultset of both thequeries must have the same no,of columns
The data types of columns in the top and the bottom queries have to be same
The positions of the columns in the top and bottom queries must be same
The final resultset can be sorted using order by 

row_number()- just numbers the row in sequence over a 
rank() - ranks all rows with or without partitions over a sorted column. It gives the same rank to similar data, but skips the next number(gap in numbering)
dense_rank() - works exactly like rank(), but does not skip numbering

Pivot : Used to generate multi dimensional report
Is used to transfer the row-wise data into column wise 

Unpivot : Is used to transfer column wise data into row-wise
