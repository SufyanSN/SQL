Indexes : An ability of the DBMS to arrange data in a logical manner for faster retrieval. Indexes sort the data permanently

are of 2 types
 1. Clustered Index: which sorts the data physically every time a dml operation is performed
                     can have only one clustered index/per table
                     automatically gets created whenever a primary key column is defined for a table
			   can be either unique on non unique, when there is no primary key defined for a table

 2. Non clustered Index : does not sort the original datain the table, instead creates an index table and sorts the data there
                          can have many non clustered index/s per table
                          allows duplicates
  - Unique Non clustered : does not allow duplicates

Group By clause

Select
from
where
group by
having
order by

where 					vs				having
used to restrict no. of rows				     used to restrict no.of groups
works before formation of group				having works after formation of group

Subqueries : They are super sets of Joins
 1. Are queries within query (inner query)
 2. Enclose subqueries in paranthese
 3. Place subqueries on the right side of the comparison condition
 4. Use Single row subquery with single row operators and multi row subquery with multi row operators

When an inner query returns one row of data, then it is single row, else if it returns more than one then, it is known as multirow subquery

Single row operators (all relational operators are single row <,>,<>,=,<=,>=)
Multi row operators (any,all,in) can be used along with the single row operator
